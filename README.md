Then it will detect the game board by applying image edge detector. A sudoku game
board contains 81 squares with number 1 - 9. The application need to identify the
number and position of each square in the puzzle. After reading all numbers, it will
calculate the solution and display it back to the image in real time. All solution numbers

slight movement of cellphone.
